/**
 * This method makes a copy in a "Recording Canvas" of the specified view but it also copies its
 * surroundings(the surrounding area is determined by surroundingThickness param), note if the background
 * of the layout containing your views has been set to "transparent" only the nodes within the
 * "window"(view + surrounding thickness) with a non transparent background will have the "focus"
 * feel(will not be applied any effect that are applied to the outer area), giving visual focus to the content
 * within the window. Nonetheless, you can add a different effect to the surrounding thickness area.
 * A limitation of this method is that the window area can't have rounded corners but in turn its content will
 * be an exact copy of the underlying view(if no effect applied to thickness area) as opposed with
 * the other method in which the surrounding area can have rounded corners but the surrounding area
 * will apply its effects(or paint color), if any, on top of any effect applied to the original
 * content(outer area, meaning, outside thickness area), like blur or a simple color painted
 * on top the screen
 *
 * @param view the view you want visual focus on
 * @param viewLocation in case you need to do some custom calculation to move the copy of the view
 * to the right location on screen, if null we will calculate it only from top to bottom(means we
 * remove the top inset) in an portrait orientation, no support for landscape orientation yet
 * @param surroundingThickness density pixels(dp) amount between the end of view and the outer area,
 * valid values are numbers >= 0
 * @param surroundingThicknessEffect if null, the copy of the surrounding is the same surrounding
 * as in original outer area
 * @param outerAreaEffect any render effect applied to surrounding area
 * @param overlayParams the params to be applied to overlay, if null it will match parent automatically
 * @param overlayColor if null no overlay will be painted, otherwise an overlay on the full screen
 * will be painted using this paint object
